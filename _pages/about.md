I am [Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I received my PhD in physics from UC San Diego in 2023.

My research interests are in the field of **galactic archeology**. I study **stellar streams** in the Milky Way and external galaxies to probe [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter). My thesis research was on detecting faint [brown dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf) at large distances (>1 kpc) to map the structure of the Milky Way. I was supervised by [Prof. Adam Burgasser](https://www.coolstarlab.org/) at UCSD, and my postdoctoral mentor is [Prof. Risa Wechsler](https://profiles.stanford.edu/risa-wechsler).
