I am [Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I received my PhD in Physics from UC San Diego in 2023.

My research interests are in the field of Galactic Archeology. I study stellar streams in the Milky Way and external galaxies to probe the structure of the dark matter. My thesis research was on detecting red and faint brown dwarfs at large distances (>1 kpc) to map the structure of the Milky Way.
