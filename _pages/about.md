I am [Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I received my PhD in Physics from UC San Diego in 2023 working with [Adam Burgasser](https://physics.ucsd.edu/Directory/Person/398)

My research interests are in the field of galactic archeology. I study stellar streams in the Milky Way and external galaxies to probe the structure of the dark matter. My thesis research was on detecting red/faint brown dwarfs at large distances (>1 kpc) to map the structure of the Milky Way.
