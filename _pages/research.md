# Gaps in Globular Cluster Stellar Streams as Probes for Dark Matter in M31 and Other Galaxies

Cosmological simulations that include dark matter predict the existence of low-mass subhalos. These subhalos can perturb thin stellar streams formed by tidal disruption of globular clusters, creating a gap-like feature like those detected in Gaia data (e.g GD-1). I predict the detectability of these gaps in nearby galaxies with the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope. 

This research is done in collaboration primarily  with [Dr. Sarah Pearson](http://drsarahpearson.com/) and [Dr. Tjitske Starkenburg](https://tstarkenburg.github.io/)

This gif shows a simulation of a stellar stream in our Galaxy being perturbed by a 10^8 solar mass subhalo. It's made using the [Gala code](http://gala.adrian.pw/en/latest/)

## Finding Brown Dwarfs and Low-mass Stars in Deep HST Paraellel Fields with Machine Learning

In [Aganze et al. 2022a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07672), we used traditional index-selection methods, and machine learning techniques (random forests and neural networks) to isolate a sample of 164 M7-T9 ultracool dwarfs up to distances of ~2~kpc in the Galaxy. Similar surveys with JWST (such as the PASSAGES survey) will uncover a comparable number of objects in the galactic thick disk and halo.

## Scaleheights and Ages Brown Dwarfs and Low-Mass Stars in Deep HST Parallel Fields

In [Aganze et al. 2022b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07621), we used the sample from Aganze et al. 2022a to constrain the scaleheight and ages using a simulation that takes into account the stellar mass function, multiplicity, UCD evolutionary models, galactic structure and survey selection function. We found that late-M dwarfs are generally older than L and T dwarfs as expected from cooling models, with median ages ranging from 3.6-2.4 Gyr.

## Metal Poor GJ 660.1AB System 

I'm also interested in the study of nearby UCDs. GJ 660.1AB is a binary system (M1 and M7 secondary) previously overlooked; in [Aganze et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08659), we showed that the peculiarities in the spectrum of the secondary can be explained by its low metallicity.

# Machine Learning Projects

I have mentored UCSD undergraduate students on summer projects that involve using supervised learning techniques (random forests and neural networks) to classify brown dwarfs and to identify rare populations (binaries, subdwarfs).
